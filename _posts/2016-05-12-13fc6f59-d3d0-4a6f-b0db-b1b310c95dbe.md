# Hello World!

This is my new website. Here you'll find everything from blog posts on topics I find interesting, links to articles and websites, photos from daily life and holidays, and much more.

This website is using a new technology in which the design of the site adapts and changes over time as more content is added. This is done using the powerful artificial intelligence and programming done by the good people at The Grid.

I'm very curious to watch the site evolve with time. So tune in regularly for more.
